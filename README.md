I wish to explain the fact that I was able to implement Drawer Navigations in the project by installing the necessary dependencies as referenced in the React Navigation Native Docs. 
I made the necessary importations and installed the dependency for react native async storage, in order to implement the Async Storage. 
The Async Storage in this project was designed and implemented in such a way that, when any random image on the HomeScreen with the add icon is being pressed, it gets stored in the CartScreen.
